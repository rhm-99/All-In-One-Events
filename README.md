# All-In-One-Events
    Created by Rhiya Mehta

All-In-One-Events is a websites created on aggregate feeds to reduce the amount of time to look for an event a user is interested in. To do this, an API is used and therefore creates a connection between the backend (done in Java) and the API. A servlet was then used to connect the frontend and backend using a variety of JSP files, Java classes and Java interface classes.

To open the project, you will need to download or clone the repository and run it in NetBeans 11.3. In order to access the website you will need to run the project from Main.java onto Microsoft Edge. You will be able to switch from page to page at the top of the page in the navigation bar below the logo and name of the website. Apache Tomcat version 8.5.55 was used as the server and the login roles for authentications was set to 'manager-script,admin,jmx'. Currently the only place that can be searched for is 'london'.
